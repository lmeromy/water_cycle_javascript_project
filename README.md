# Javascript paired project: Water Cycle Learning App
Fullstack Educational tool to help children learn about the water cycle, paired project

This was our 2nd CodeClan project, and was assigned to do in pairs. My partner, Anna Henderson, and I created a single-page educational application with content and tools to help students (ages 7-11) learn about different aspects of the water cycle and become more conscious of their own daily water use. 

## Specific elements of the app include:
1. Responsive main image with click-able areas displaying different content
2. Short quiz to consolidate knowledge gained from exploring the above image
3. Interactive tool for students to see their own water use based on daily habits and compare their habits to average UK users

## Technologies used:
1. Javascript
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. MongoDB
5. Express
